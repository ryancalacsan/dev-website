          Hello there, Iâ€™m a developer from Chicago with a passion for crafting
          beautiful and efficient web applications. With expertise in front-end
          development and experience across the full stack, I bring ideas to
          life using technologies like JavaScript, React, and Firebase. When Iâ€™m
          not coding, you might find me exploring the city, a mountain, or
          working on creative side projects. Letâ€™s build something amazing
          together!
