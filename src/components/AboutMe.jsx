        Hello there, Iâ€™m a developer from Chicago with a passion for crafting
        beautiful and efficient web applications. With expertise in front-end
        development and experience across the full stack, I bring ideas to life
        using technologies like JavaScript, React, and Firebase. When Iâ€™m not
        coding, you might find me exploring the city or working on creative side
        projects. Letâ€™s build something amazing together!
